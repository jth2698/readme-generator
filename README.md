# README Generator [![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)
## Description
This is a simple README generator built as a command line interface (CLI) intended for use through node.js. When index.js is called within node (`node index.js`), the generator will prompt the user to provide information needed for the README and will then generate a README.md (markdown) file in the "readme-output" directory.

## Installation
The README Generator repository should be cloned locally. The user should then navigate to the README directory through a command line interface and should run `node index.js` to initialize the generator. It is assumed that the user already has node.js installed.

## Usage
After running `node index.js`, the user will be prompted to enter the data needed to generate the README. Once the information is provided, the generator will automatically populate a README.md file in the readme-output directory (included in the repo).

## Contribution Guidelines
All contributions are welcome. Feel free to open a pull request.

## Testing
We recommend testing using the usage method above.
